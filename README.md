# Two-dimensional-Synthetic-Crystal-Phase-Problem
The implementation of Iterative Projections to Solve the Two-dimensional Synthetic Crystal Phase Problem

A computational tool has been developed to determine protein’s crystal structure from its corresponding diffraction data. This tool relies on both the atomicity constraints in real space and the intensity constraints in reciprocal space. To restore the electron density map of a protein’s crystal from the magnitude of its complex structure factor, the difference-map algorithm is used to converge two projections based on both sets of constraints. Here we implement this algorithm to recover unknown 2D simulated atomic diffraction pattern images from its magnitude information in Fourier moduli.
